# Videosynth - WIP
A little interactive Videosynthesizer that simulates videofeedback, the process of pointing a camera at its own playback monitor.

The videosynth is split into two parts:
    Preprocessing stage: the actual self modulating image synthesis containing:
        * Random Noise Generator
        * Color Generator
        * Feedback Simulator

    Postprocessing stage:
        * BGR Filter    


## Prerequisites

To run this script python as well as the opencv and numpy libraries must be installed.

Run

This project was inspired by several reddit posts on r/videosynthesis by user u/STEEDOE.
