# Videosynth - WIP
<p>A little interactive Videosynthesizer that simulates videofeedback, the process of pointing a camera at its own playback monitor.</p>

<p>The videosynth is split into two parts: </p>
<p>Preprocessing stage: the actual self modulating image synthesis containing:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Random Noise Generator </li>
    <li> Color Generator </li>
    <li> Feedback Simulator </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> Postprocessing stage: does not influence videosynthesis:</p>
<ul>
    <li> BGR Filter </li>
</ul> 


## Prerequisites

<p>To run this script python as well as the opencv and numpy libraries must be installed.</p>


<p>This project was inspired by several reddit posts on r/videosynthesis by user u/STEEDOE.</p>
